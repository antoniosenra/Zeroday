<p>We are third-year students at the University of Chicago Law School. After taking classes related to
  data security, we became motivated to create a website that made it easier for people to ensure
  their data was safe and to get the legal recourse they're entitled to.</p>
<p>We are using an API that belongs to <a href="www.HaveIBeenPwned.com">HaveIBeenPwned</a>. Their API
	is what allows us to quickly retrieve information on whether a user has been compromised in a
	breach.</p>
